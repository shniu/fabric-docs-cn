Using Jira to understand current work items-使用Jira来了解当前的工作流项
===========================================

This document has been created to give further insight into the work in
progress towards the Hyperledger Fabric v1 architecture based on the
community roadmap. The requirements for the roadmap are being tracked in
`Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org/>`__.

本文档旨在创建进一步了解基于社区路线图的Hyperledger Fabric v1架构方面的工作进展。
路线图在 `Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org/>`__ 被更踪。

It was determined to organize in sprints to better track and show a
prioritized order of items to be implemented based on feedback received.
We’ve done this via boards. To see these boards and the priorities click
on **Boards** -> **Manage Boards**:

采用Sprints来管理，并且展示在反馈列表中的问题实现的优先级。我们使用面板来实现这些功能。通过点击
 **Boards** -> **Manage Boards** 来查看这些面板：

Now on the left side of the screen click on **All boards**:

On this page you will see all the public (and restricted) boards that
have been created. If you want to see the items with current sprint
focus, click on the boards where the column labeled **Visibility** is
**All Users** and the column **Board type** is labeled **Scrum**. For
example the **Board Name** Consensus:

在这里，你可以看到b所有被创建的公共的（或者受限制的）面板。
如果你想看当前sprint下的条目，请点击 **可见性** 为 **全部用户** ，而且 **面板类型** 
是 **Scrum** 的。举个例子， **面板名称** Consensus：

When you click on Consensus under **Board name** you will be directed to
a page that contains the following columns:

当你点击了 **面板名称** 下的Consensus之后，你会被重定向到下面的列中：

The meanings to these columns are as follows:

这些列的含义如下:

-  Backlog – list of items slated for the current sprint (sprints are
   defined in 2 week iterations), but are not currently in progress

-  Backlog – 为当前sprint计划的条目 (sprints的定义是2周一个迭代), 但是不在当前的sprint中。

-  In progress – items currently being worked by someone in the
   community.

-  In progress – 由某些人正在进行的条目。

-  In Review – items waiting to be reviewed and merged in Gerrit

-  In Review – 在Gerrit中正在等待审查和合并的条目。

-  Done – items merged and complete in the sprint.

-  Done – 在这个sprint中已经合并完成的条目。

If you want to see all items in the backlog for a given feature set,
click on the stacked rows on the left navigation of the screen:

如果你希望查看某一个特性的backlog的所有条目，点击导航栏左侧堆积的行即可：

.. figure:: images/Jira4.png
   :alt: Jira boards

   Jira boards

This shows you items slated for the current sprint at the top, and all
items in the backlog at the bottom. Items are listed in priority order.

这张图展示了当前的sprint的条目，所有的底部的待办的条目。所有的条目都按优先级排列。

If there is an item you are interested in working on, want more
information or have questions, or if there is an item that you feel
needs to be in higher priority, please add comments directly to the Jira
item. All feedback and help is very much appreciated.

如果有一个你感兴趣的条目正在进行，你有一些问题或者想了解一些信息，
或者你觉得有些条目有必要提高优先级，请在Jira上直接评论。
感谢所有有帮助的反馈和帮助。
